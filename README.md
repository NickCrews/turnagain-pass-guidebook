# Turnagain Pass Guidebook

Your companion for skiing in Turnagain Pass, Alaska

## Goals

### Open Source
This is your public land. Info on it should be too.
If you don't like this info, you are free to fork your own
version and change it to your liking.

### Community Driven
Please submit corrections and suggestions.
The help of many will polish this to it's best version.
Note that I reserve the right to make final decisions (for now)

### Useful
Maps, descriptions, etc can actually help you plan a trip.
eg where is good for a storm day? What are your exit options
for high-avalanche danger day?

### Digital-first
We can do better than book-only guidebooks.
We have PDF export for offline use and printing, of course.
But just as good is a website, allowing for
- search
- interactive maps
- links and external resources
- live conditions
- realtime corrections and updates
- etc.
